# Frame Selection and Object Detection using YOLOv5

## Overview
This project is designed to extract key frames from a video using three different selection methods and perform object detection using the YOLOv5 model. The extracted frames can be used for analysis, summarization, or further processing.

## Features
- **Frame selection methods:**
  - Uniform Sampling
  - Scene Change Detection
  - Motion Analysis
- **Object Detection using YOLOv5**
- **Visualization of detected objects**

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- SceneDetect
- PyTorch
- Ultralytics YOLOv5

## Installation
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy scenedetect torch torchvision torchaudio
```

If using Google Colab, you may need to run:
```python
from google.colab.patches import cv2_imshow
```


## Usage
1. Replace `video_path` in the script with the path to your video file.
2. Choose a frame selection method:
   ```python
   selected_frames = select_frames_uniform_sampling(video_path)
   # or
   selected_frames = select_frames_scene_change_detection(video_path)
   # or
   selected_frames = select_frames_motion_analysis(video_path)
   ```
3. Run the script to extract frames and detect objects.

## Frame Selection Methods Comparison

| Method | How It Works | Advantages | Disadvantages | Best Use Cases |
|---------|-------------|------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Uniform Sampling** | Selects frames at regular intervals based on total frame count. | - Simple and efficient<br>- Ensures even distribution across the video<br>- Works well for videos with consistent motion | - May miss keyframes with significant motion changes<br>- Not optimized for scene transitions | - When computational efficiency is important<br>- When the video has uniform motion and object distribution |
| **Scene Change Detection** | Uses scene detection algorithms to select frames where significant changes occur. | - Captures keyframes at scene transitions<br>- More informative than uniform sampling for scene-based videos | - Computationally expensive<br>- Might miss gradual transitions or rapid motion changes | - Videos with multiple distinct scenes<br>- Ad-based or movie clip analysis |
| **Motion-Based Selection** | Uses optical flow to track significant motion changes and selects frames with the highest motion. | - Focuses on dynamic frames<br>- Captures objects in action | - Requires more computation (optical flow analysis)<br>- Might not work well for static scenes | - Sports videos, surveillance footage, and action-packed content |

### Summary:
- If **speed and efficiency** are the top priorities, **Uniform Sampling** is the best choice.
- If the video consists of **multiple distinct scenes**, **Scene Change Detection** is the preferred method.
- If the goal is to **capture movement-heavy frames**, **Motion-Based Selection** is the most effective.

## Example Output
The script will display frames with detected objects highlighted using bounding boxes and labels.
